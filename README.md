# spaCy + UDPipe

This package wraps the fast and efficient [UDPipe](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe) language-agnostic NLP pipeline
(via its [Python bindings](https://github.com/ufal/udpipe/tree/master/bindings/python)), so you can use
[UDPipe pre-trained models](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2998) as a [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) pipeline for 50+ languages out-of-the-box.
Inspired by [spacy-stanfordnlp](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-stanfordnlp), this package offers slightly less accurate
models that are in turn much faster (see benchmarks for [UDPipe](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe/models#universal_dependencies_24_models_performance) and [StanfordNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanfordnlp/performance.html)).

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install spacy-udpipe.

```bash
pip install spacy-udpipe
```

After installation, use `spacy_udpipe.download(lang)` to download the pre-trained model for the desired language.

## Usage
The loaded UDPipeLanguage class returns a spaCy [`Language` object](https://spacy.io/api/language), i.e., the nlp object you can use to process text and create a [`Doc` object](https://spacy.io/api/doc).

```python
import spacy_udpipe

spacy_udpipe.download("en") # download English model

text = "Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world."
nlp = spacy_udpipe.load("en")

doc = nlp(text)
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_, token.dep_)

```
As all attributes are computed once and set in the custom [`Tokenizer`](https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer), the `nlp.pipeline` is empty.

## Notes
* All available pre-trained models are licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

* All annotations match with Spacy's, except for token.tag_, which map from [CoNLL](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html) XPOS tag (language-specific part-of-speech tag), defined for each language separately by the corresponding [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) treebank.

* Full list of supported languages and models is available in [`languages.json`](https://github.com/TakeLab/spacy-udpipe/blob/master/spacy_udpipe/languages.json).

* This package exposes a `spacy_languages` entry point in its [`setup.py`](https://github.com/TakeLab/spacy-udpipe/blob/master/setup.py) so full suport for serialization is enabled:
    ```python
    nlp = spacy_udpipe.load("en")
    nlp.to_disk("./udpipe-spacy-model")

    ```
    To properly load a saved model, you must pass the `udpipe_model` argument when loading it:
    ```python
    udpipe_model = spacy_udpipe.UDPipeModel("en")
    nlp = spacy.load("./udpipe-spacy-model", udpipe_model=udpipe_model)

    ```
